Casino CashRake Bonus Profitability Simulation (Python)
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Python-based simulation and forecasting model designed to evaluate the profitability of a casino CashRake bonus system over a 12-month period. It analyzes how player growth, rewards, revenue, and costs interact under different bonus and growth assumptions.

The model helps answer a critical business question:

Is the CashRake bonus sustainable and profitable as player activity scales?

🎯 Objectives

Simulate casino player growth over time

Forecast revenue, costs, and profit

Evaluate the impact of bonus payouts

Compare original vs predictive scenarios

Support decision-making through data storytelling

🧮 Methodology

The analysis uses a scenario-based simulation approach, including:

Baseline (original) performance modeling

Predictive simulations with adjusted assumptions

Hybrid models combining observed and forecasted trends

Month-by-month tracking across a 12-month horizon

📊 Key Scenarios Analyzed

Original Model – Based on historical assumptions

5HE Predictive Model – Enhanced growth & engagement assumptions

Hybrid Model – Combination of real data and projections

Each scenario evaluates:

Player count growth

Revenue generation

Bonus and operational costs

Net profitability
